# Music-Genre-Classification.
Music Analysis is done based on a songâ€™s digital signatures for some factors, including acoustics, danceability, tempo, energy etc., to determine the kind of songs that a person is interested to listen to.
Music is characterized by giving them categorical labels called genres. These genres are created by humans. A music genre is segregated by the characteristics which are commonly shared by its members. Typically, these characteristics are related to the rhythmic structure, instrumentation, and the harmonic content of the music.
