# Music-Genre-Classification.
INTRODUCTION:-
An audio signal used to
represent sound has characteristics including
frequency, bandwidth, and decibel level. The
amplitude and time functions can be used to
express a typical audio signal. The fact that
these audio signals are available in a variety of
formats make it possible and simple for the
computer to read and analyse them. Among
the formats are mp3, Wav (Waveform Audio
File), and WMA (Windows Media Audio).
To ascertain the types of songs that a person
is interested in listening to, music analysis is
done based on a song's digital signatures for
several aspects, including acoustics,
danceability, tempo, energy, etc.
By assigning it categorization labels known as
genres, music is given character. These genres
were developed by people. A musical genre is
distinguished by the traits that its participants
frequently share. These traits typically relate
to the music's harmonic content,
instrumentation, and rhythmic structure. It is
a highly difficult task in the discipline of Music
Information Retrieval (MIR), which deals with
viewing, organising, and searching enormous
music collections, to classify music files into
their various genres.
As the digital entertainment sector expanded
quickly in recent years, the idea of automatic
music genre classification gained a lot of
popularity. It is arbitrary to divide music into
genres, however there are perceptual
standards linked to instrumentation, rhythmic
structure, and musical texture that can help
identify a certain genre. Music that is
available digitally has previously been
classified by genre by hand. Therefore,
methods for automatically classifying genres
would be a useful complement to the creation
of music audio information retrieval systems.

ABSTRACT:-
The importance of music in
people's lives cannot be overstated. Likeminded people come together via music,
and it serves as the community's binding
agent. The genres of music that different
communities write or even just listen to
can be used to identify them. Finding a
machine learning system that can predict
a song's genre better than the existing
models is the goal of our study and
research. In this research, we constructed
a number of categorization models and
trained them using data from the Free
Music Archive (FMA). All of these models'
performances have been compared, and
the results have been logged in terms of
prediction accuracy. A select few of these
models are trained using both the Melspectrograms and the audio
characteristics of the songs, while a
select few others are learned exclusively
using the spectrograms of the songs. The
convolutional neural network model,
which was given only the spectrograms
as the dataset, produced the best results
of all the models in terms of accuracy.
